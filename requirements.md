## Non-Functional Requirements
1. Security
    * We are using auth0 for secure login and will be getting data about the user from auth0 instead of storing in sate. We want the end user of the store to have a custom experience tailored to their account.
2. Usability
    * A clear and functional UI that works how you would expect it to as a customer. To allow filtering via either text or category, allowing customers to easily find what they are wanting.
